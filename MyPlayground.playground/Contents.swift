//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

// import a framework, which is code that is proviede to you to use
// a UIKit emcompasses all of the UI stuff that you need to build an iOS app and to use very basic stuff, like strings, and images, etc.
import UIKit

// Define variables: VAR or LET
var s:String? = nil     // ? may not be String
s = "Hey"

var str:String = "Hello, playground"

var num = 3

print(num)

var image = UIImage(named: "tomcat.png")

// let is safer, and if something's not supposed to change, define it as a constant
let constant = "Cannot be changed!!!"
